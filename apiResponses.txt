The `run.py` script serves as the entry point for launching a Streamlit application that is part of a larger project. Below is a detailed analysis of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of `run.py` is to execute the Streamlit application defined in `src/app/main.py`. It checks for the existence of the application file and then uses the `subprocess` module to run the Streamlit server. This script is crucial for users or developers who want to start the application easily without needing to navigate to the specific directory or manually run the Streamlit command.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
- **`main()`**: This is the main function of the script. Its responsibilities include:
  - Defining the path to the Streamlit application (`src/app/main.py`).
  - Checking if the application file exists. If it does not, it prints an error message and exits the script with a non-zero status code.
  - Attempting to run the Streamlit application using the `subprocess.run()` method. If the command fails (for example, if Streamlit is not installed or there are errors in the application), it catches the exception and prints an error message before exiting.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **File Path Handling**: The script uses `Path` from the `pathlib` module to construct the file path for the Streamlit application. This approach is more robust and cross-platform compared to using string paths directly.
- **Subprocess Interaction**: The script interacts with the system shell through the `subprocess` module, which allows it to run external commands (in this case, the Streamlit command). This interaction is crucial for launching the Streamlit server and is a common pattern in Python scripts that need to execute shell commands.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling for both file existence and subprocess execution. This is important for user experience, as it provides clear feedback about what went wrong if the application fails to start.
- **Modular Design**: By separating the main functionality into a `main()` function and using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct, the script is designed to be both executable as a standalone script and importable as a module without executing the main function. This is a common best practice in Python

The `rag.py` file implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which is a sophisticated approach to enhance the capabilities of language models by integrating them with external data sources. Below is a detailed analysis of its key functionalities and roles:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of the `RAGPipeline` class is to manage the RAG process, which combines retrieval of relevant information from a vector database with the generative capabilities of a language model (LLM). This allows the system to provide contextually relevant answers to user queries by retrieving pertinent documents or data before generating a response.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
- **`__init__(self, vector_db: Any, llm_manager: LLMManager)`**: 
  - This is the constructor for the `RAGPipeline` class. It initializes the pipeline with a vector database and an LLM manager. It also sets up the retriever and the processing chain.
  
- **`_setup_retriever(self) -> MultiQueryRetriever`**:
  - This private method configures a `MultiQueryRetriever` using the vector database and the language model. It retrieves relevant documents based on the queries provided to the LLM. If any error occurs during setup, it logs the error and raises an exception.

- **`_setup_chain(self) -> Any`**:
  - This private method establishes the processing chain that combines the context retrieved by the retriever with the question input. It utilizes the LLM and an output parser to format the response. Similar to `_setup_retriever`, it logs errors and raises exceptions if issues arise.

- **`get_response(self, question: str) -> str`**:
  - This public method is the main interface for users to query the RAG pipeline. It takes a question as input, retrieves relevant context, and generates a response using the configured chain. It logs the question being processed and handles any exceptions that may occur during the response generation.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **Interaction with `LLMManager`**: The `RAGPipeline` relies heavily on the `LLMManager` class to manage the language model and provide necessary prompts for both retrieval and generation. This indicates a modular design where the language model's configuration and behavior are encapsulated within the `LLMManager`.
  
- **Integration with `MultiQueryRetriever`

The `src/core/embeddings.py` file is a crucial component of a larger system that deals with vector embeddings and database functionality, particularly in the context of document processing and retrieval. Below is a detailed analysis of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of the `embeddings.py` module is to manage vector embeddings and facilitate operations related to a vector database. This involves creating a vector database from a set of documents and providing functionality to delete that database when necessary. The use of embeddings allows the system to represent documents in a high-dimensional space, enabling efficient similarity searches and retrieval operations.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
- **`__init__(self, embedding_model: str = "nomic-embed-text")`**: 
  - This is the constructor for the `VectorStore` class. It initializes an instance of the class with a specified embedding model (defaulting to "nomic-embed-text"). It creates an instance of `OllamaEmbeddings`, which is presumably a class that handles the generation of embeddings for text documents.

- **`create_vector_db(self, documents: List, collection_name: str = "local-rag") -> Chroma`**:
  - This method is responsible for creating a vector database from a list of documents. It uses the `Chroma` class from the `langchain_community.vectorstores` module to create the database, which is populated with the embeddings generated from the provided documents. It logs the process and handles exceptions by logging errors and re-raising them.

- **`delete_collection(self) -> None`**:
  - This method deletes the vector database collection if it exists. It logs the deletion process and handles any exceptions that may occur during the deletion. If successful, it sets the `vector_db` attribute to `None`.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **Embedding Model**: The `VectorStore` class interacts with the `OllamaEmbeddings` class to generate embeddings for the documents. This is a key interaction as it allows the system to convert textual data into a format suitable for vector storage and retrieval.

- **Vector Database**: The `create_vector_db` method interacts with the `Chroma` class to create and manage the vector database. This interaction is essential for storing the embeddings in a structured way that allows for efficient querying and retrieval.

- **Logging

The `src/core/llm.py` file is responsible for managing the configuration and setup of a Language Model (LLM) within the broader application. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of the `LLMManager` class is to encapsulate the functionality related to the configuration and usage of a language model, specifically the `ChatOllama` model from the `langchain_ollama` library. This class is responsible for:
- Initializing the language model with a specified model name.
- Providing templates for generating prompts that can be used to interact with the language model for various tasks, such as querying and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
The `LLMManager` class contains the following key functions:

- **`__init__(self, model_name: str = "llama2")`**:
  - This is the constructor method that initializes an instance of the `LLMManager`. It accepts a `model_name` parameter (defaulting to "llama2") and initializes the `ChatOllama` model with this name. This sets up the language model for use in subsequent operations.

- **`get_query_prompt(self) -> PromptTemplate`**:
  - This method returns a `PromptTemplate` designed for generating alternative versions of a userâ€™s question. The purpose of this prompt is to enhance the effectiveness of document retrieval from a vector database by providing multiple perspectives on the original question. This can help mitigate limitations associated with similarity searches.

- **`get_rag_prompt(self) -> ChatPromptTemplate`**:
  - This method provides a `ChatPromptTemplate` specifically for RAG tasks. It constructs a prompt that instructs the language model to answer a question based solely on a given context. This is crucial for ensuring that the model's responses are grounded in the provided information, which is essential for accurate and relevant output.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The `LLMManager` class interacts with several components of the system:
- **`ChatOllama`**: This is the core language model being utilized. The `LLMManager` initializes this model and uses it to generate responses based on the prompts defined in its methods.
- **Prompt Templates**: The prompts generated by `get_query_prompt` and `get_rag

The `rag.py` file contains the implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which is a system designed to enhance the generation of responses by retrieving relevant information from a database before generating a final output. Below is a detailed analysis of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of the `RAGPipeline` class is to manage the RAG process, which combines retrieval of relevant documents or data from a vector database with the generation of responses using a language model (LLM). The class is responsible for setting up the necessary components for this pipeline, including the retriever and the generation chain, and for providing a method to get responses based on user queries.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
- **`__init__(self, vector_db: Any, llm_manager: LLMManager)`**: This is the constructor method that initializes the RAG pipeline. It takes a vector database and an instance of `LLMManager` as arguments. It sets up the retriever and the generation chain by calling the respective setup methods.
  
- **`_setup_retriever(self) -> MultiQueryRetriever`**: This private method configures the multi-query retriever using the vector database and the language model. It creates an instance of `MultiQueryRetriever` that can handle multiple queries simultaneously. If there is an error during setup, it logs the error and raises an exception.

- **`_setup_chain(self) -> Any`**: This private method establishes the RAG chain that combines the context from the retriever, the question input, and the language model. It uses a `RunnablePassthrough` for the question input and an output parser to format the final response. Similar to the retriever setup, it logs errors and raises exceptions if any issues occur.

- **`get_response(self, question: str) -> str`**: This public method is the main interface for users of the RAG pipeline. It takes a question as input, retrieves relevant information using the configured retriever, and generates a response using the language model. It logs the question being processed and handles any exceptions that arise during the response generation.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **Interaction with `LLMManager`**: The `RAGPipeline` class relies on the `LLMManager` for accessing the language model and the prompts necessary for

The `tests/test_models.py` file is a set of unit tests designed to validate the functionality of the `extract_model_names` function from the `src.app.main` module. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key aspects:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of this test file is to ensure that the `extract_model_names` function behaves correctly under various conditions. It verifies that the function can handle different types of input, including empty responses, successful extractions, invalid formats, and exceptional cases. By doing so, it helps maintain the reliability and robustness of the application.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
The file contains four test functions, each targeting a specific scenario:

- **`test_extract_model_names_empty`**: This test checks the behavior of `extract_model_names` when provided with an empty response. It ensures that the function returns an empty tuple when there are no models to extract.

- **`test_extract_model_names_success`**: This test simulates a successful extraction of model names. It creates mock model objects with specific names and verifies that the function correctly returns a tuple containing those names.

- **`test_extract_model_names_invalid_format`**: This test evaluates how the function handles an input that does not conform to the expected format (in this case, a dictionary with an unexpected structure). It checks that the function returns an empty tuple when the input is invalid.

- **`test_extract_model_names_exception`**: This test examines the function's robustness in the face of exceptions. It deliberately removes the `models` attribute from the mock object to trigger an `AttributeError` and confirms that the function handles this gracefully by returning an empty tuple.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The tests interact directly with the `extract_model_names` function, which is presumably responsible for extracting model names from a given input structure (likely a response from an API or a data source). The tests utilize the `Mock` class from the `unittest.mock` module to simulate various input scenarios without requiring actual model objects or responses. This allows for isolated testing of the function's logic.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Use of Mocking**: The tests leverage mocking extensively to create controlled environments for testing. This is a common pattern in unit testing, allowing developers to simulate complex objects and focus on the functionality being tested.

- **Assertions for Expected Outcomes**: Each

It ensures that the pipeline correctly sets up its components, processes input queries, and handles various scenarios, including normal operations and error conditions. The tests verify that the pipeline can retrieve information and generate responses based on user queries.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
- **`setUp(self)`**: This method is executed before each test case. It initializes mock objects and patches necessary components to isolate the `RAGPipeline` from its dependencies. This includes mocking the vector database and language model manager, as well as setting up mock behavior for the retriever and chain components.

- **`tearDown(self)`**: This method cleans up the patches after each test case to ensure that the mock objects do not interfere with subsequent tests.

- **`test_setup_retriever(self)`**: Tests the `_setup_retriever` method of the `RAGPipeline` to ensure it correctly creates a retriever from the vector database.

- **`test_setup_chain(self)`**: Tests the `_setup_chain` method to verify that it correctly sets up the processing chain using the language model manager.

- **`test_get_response(self)`**: Tests the `get_response` method of the `RAGPipeline` to ensure it can generate a response to a given question. It checks that the response matches the expected output and that the chain's `invoke` method is called with the correct input.

- **`test_get_response_empty_question(self)`**: Verifies that the pipeline correctly handles an empty question, returning an empty response.

- **`test_get_response_long_question(self)`**: Tests the pipeline's ability to handle very long questions, ensuring it can still generate a valid response.

- **`test_get_response_special_characters(self)`**: Ensures that the pipeline can handle questions containing special characters.

- **`test_chain_error_handling(self)`

To analyze the `ollama_pdf_rag` project and create a call hierarchy, we will outline the main execution path starting from the entry point, detailing the flow of function calls between files, and highlighting the dependencies between modules. 

### 1. Entry Point File
The entry point for the application is:
- **`src/app/main.py`**

### 2. Main Execution Flow
The main execution flow can be summarized as follows:

1. **`main.py`**: This file initializes the Streamlit application and sets up the main interface. It likely imports components from the `app` directory and the `core` functionalities.

2. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the Streamlit interface, which triggers various functions in the `chat.py`, `pdf_viewer.py`, and `sidebar.py` files.
