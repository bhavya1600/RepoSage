The prompt instructs the language model to produce two variations of the input question.

- **`get_rag_prompt(self) -> ChatPromptTemplate`**:
  - This method returns a `ChatPromptTemplate` designed for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. It constructs a prompt that instructs the LLM to answer a question based solely on a provided context. This is crucial for ensuring that the model's responses are grounded in specific information rather than generating answers based on general knowledge.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- The `LLMManager` interacts with the `ChatOllama` class from the `langchain_ollama` library, which is responsible for the underlying language model functionality. This interaction allows the `LLMManager` to leverage the capabilities of the LLM for generating responses and processing queries.
- The prompt templates generated by `get_query_prompt` and `get_rag_prompt` are likely used by other components of the application, such as those responsible for handling user interactions or document retrieval, thereby facilitating the overall functionality of the system.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Encapsulation of LLM Logic**: The `LLMManager` encapsulates the logic related to LLM configuration and prompt generation, promoting a clean separation of concerns within the codebase. This design makes it easier to manage and modify LLM-related functionality without affecting other parts of the application.
- **Use of Prompt Templates**: The use of `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate` indicates a structured approach to generating prompts for the LLM. This pattern allows for flexibility and reusability of prompt formats across different queries and contexts.
- **Logging**: The inclusion of a logger (`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`) suggests that the class may have logging capabilities for debugging or tracking purposes, although specific logging statements are not present in the provided code snippet.

Overall, the `src/core/llm.py` file plays a crucial role in managing the language model's configuration and facilitating effective interactions with it through well-defined prompt templates.

The `src/core/rag.py` file implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which is a method used in natural language processing to enhance the generation of text by incorporating relevant information retrieved from a database. Below is a detailed analysis of the key functionalities and roles of this code:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of the `RAGPipeline` class is to manage the RAG process, which combines retrieval of relevant documents or data from a vector database with the generation of responses using a language model. This class encapsulates the logic for setting up the retriever and the generation chain, as well as handling user queries to produce informed responses.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
- **`__init__(self, vector_db: Any, llm_manager: LLMManager)`**: 
  - This is the constructor method that initializes the RAG pipeline. It takes a vector database and an instance of `LLMManager` as parameters. It sets up the retriever and the generation chain by calling the respective setup methods.

- **`_setup_retriever(self) -> MultiQueryRetriever`**:
  - This private method configures the multi-query retriever using the vector database and the language model. It creates an instance of `MultiQueryRetriever` that is responsible for fetching relevant documents based on the input query. If an error occurs during setup, it logs the error and raises an exception.

- **`_setup_chain(self) -> Any`**:
  - This private method establishes the RAG chain, which combines the context retrieved by the retriever with the language model's capabilities to generate a response. It uses `RunnablePassthrough` to pass the question through the chain, and `StrOutputParser` to format the output. Similar to the retriever setup, it logs errors and raises exceptions if any issues arise.

- **`get_response(self, question: str) -> str`**:
  - This public method is the main interface for users to interact with the RAG pipeline. It takes a question as input, retrieves relevant context, and generates a response using the configured chain. It logs the question being processed and handles any exceptions that may occur during the response generation.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **Interaction with `LLMManager`**:
  - The `RAGPipeline` relies on the `LLMManager` for accessing the language model and its associated query prompts. This interaction is crucial for both setting up the retriever and generating responses.

- **Integration with Vector Database**:
  - The pipeline uses a vector database to retrieve relevant documents based on the input question. The `vector_db` parameter passed to the constructor is expected to have a method `as_retriever()` that allows it to be used in the retrieval process.

- **Use of Langchain Components**:
  - The implementation utilizes components from the Langchain library, such as `RunnablePassthrough`, `MultiQueryRetriever`, and `StrOutputParser`, which indicates that the RAG pipeline is designed to work within a larger framework that supports modular and composable workflows for handling language tasks.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Error Handling and Logging**:
  - The code includes structured error handling and logging throughout the setup and response generation processes. This is a good practice that aids in debugging and monitoring the system's behavior during execution.

- **Modular Design**:
  - The separation of concerns is evident in the design, with distinct methods for setting up the retriever and the chain. This modularity enhances maintainability and allows for easier testing and potential future enhancements.

- **Use of Type Hints**:
  - The code employs type hints (e.g., `Any`, `Dict`) to clarify the expected types of parameters and return values, improving code readability and aiding developers in understanding the expected data structures.

In summary, the `src/core/rag.py` file defines a robust RAG pipeline that integrates document retrieval with language generation, providing a structured approach to handling user queries while ensuring maintainability and error management.

The `tests/test_document.py` file is a set of unit tests designed to verify the functionality of the `DocumentProcessor` class from the `src.core.document` module. Here's a detailed breakdown of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of this test file is to ensure that the `DocumentProcessor` behaves as expected when processing documents, particularly PDFs. It tests various aspects of document loading, splitting, and metadata handling, ensuring that the class can handle both typical and edge cases effectively.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
- **Fixtures**:
  - `processor()`: This fixture creates an instance of `DocumentProcessor` that can be reused across multiple tests, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.
  - `test_pdf_path()`: This fixture provides a path to a sample PDF file used in tests.

- **Tests**:
  - `test_init(processor)`: Verifies that the default initialization of `DocumentProcessor` sets the correct chunk size and overlap.
  - `test_init_custom_params()`: Tests initialization with custom parameters to ensure that the processor can accept and correctly set user-defined values.
  - `test_load_pdf_file_not_found(mock_load)`: Checks that attempting to load a non-existent PDF raises a `FileNotFoundError`, using mocking to simulate this behavior.
  - `test_load_pdf_success(processor, test_pdf_path)`: Tests the successful loading of a valid PDF file, asserting that it returns documents with content.
  - `test_split_documents(processor)`: Validates that a long document can be split into multiple chunks.
  - `test_split_empty_document(processor)`: Ensures that an empty document is handled correctly, resulting in either no chunks or a single empty chunk.
  - `test_split_large_document(processor)`: Tests the splitting of a very large document, confirming that the resulting chunks do not exceed the specified chunk size.
  - `test_metadata_preservation(processor)`: Checks that metadata is preserved in all chunks after splitting a document.
  - `test_chunk_overlap()`: Verifies that the overlapping functionality of chunks works correctly, ensuring that consecutive chunks share the specified amount of content.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **DocumentProcessor**: The tests directly interact with the `DocumentProcessor` class, which is responsible for loading and processing documents. The tests validate its methods such as `load_pdf` and `split_documents`.
- **Mocking**: The `unittest.mock` library is used to simulate the behavior of external dependencies (like PDF loading) without relying on actual files, allowing for isolated testing of the `DocumentProcessor`.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Use of Fixtures**: The use of pytest fixtures (`processor` and `test_pdf_path`) promotes code reuse and clarity, making the tests easier to read and maintain.
- **Error Handling Tests**: The tests include checks for error conditions (e.g., loading a non-existent file), which is crucial for robust software development.
- **Parameterized Testing**: The tests cover various scenarios, including edge cases like empty documents and large documents, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the `DocumentProcessor` functionality.
- **Assertions on Metadata**: The tests not only check the content of the documents but also ensure that metadata is handled correctly, highlighting the importance of preserving contextual information during processing.

Overall, this test file plays a critical role in maintaining the reliability and correctness of the document processing functionality within the application, ensuring that changes to the `DocumentProcessor` do not introduce regressions or bugs.

The `tests/test_models.py` file is a unit test module designed to validate the functionality of the `extract_model_names` function from the `src.app.main` module. Here’s a detailed analysis of its key functionalities and roles:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of this test file is to ensure that the `extract_model_names` function behaves correctly under various scenarios. This involves verifying that the function can handle different types of input, including empty responses, valid model data, invalid formats, and unexpected exceptions. By doing so, the tests help maintain the reliability and robustness of the codebase.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
The test file contains four main test functions, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `extract_model_names` function:

- **`test_extract_model_names_empty()`**:
  - **Purpose**: Tests the function's behavior when provided with an empty response.
  - **Functionality**: It creates a mock object with an empty `models` list and asserts that the result is an empty tuple, indicating that no model names can be extracted.

- **`test_extract_model_names_success()`**:
  - **Purpose**: Tests the function's ability to successfully extract model names from a valid response.
  - **Functionality**: It creates two mock model objects with specific model names, constructs a mock response containing these models, and asserts that the extracted names match the expected tuple of model names.

- **`test_extract_model_names_invalid_format()`**:
  - **Purpose**: Tests how the function handles an invalid input format.
  - **Functionality**: It provides a dictionary that does not conform to the expected structure (lacking a `models` attribute) and asserts that the result is an empty tuple, indicating that no model names can be extracted.

- **`test_extract_model_names_exception()`**:
  - **Purpose**: Tests the function's resilience to unexpected exceptions during execution.
  - **Functionality**: It creates a mock object and deliberately deletes the `models` attribute to simulate an error condition. The test asserts that the function returns an empty tuple, demonstrating that it can handle the situation gracefully without crashing.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The tests interact directly with the `extract_model_names` function, which is presumably responsible for processing a response object that contains model information. The tests utilize Python's `unittest.mock` library to create mock objects that simulate the expected behavior of the actual model data structures. This allows the tests to focus on the logic of `extract_model_names` without relying on real data or external dependencies.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Use of Mock Objects**: The tests leverage mock objects extensively to simulate various scenarios without needing actual model instances. This is a common pattern in unit testing that helps isolate the function being tested.
  
- **Clear Assertions**: Each test concludes with an assertion that clearly defines the expected outcome, making it easy to understand what each test is verifying.

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The tests cover a range of scenarios, including normal operation, edge cases (like empty inputs), invalid formats, and error handling, which is indicative of good testing practices.

- **Descriptive Docstrings**: Each test function includes a docstring that succinctly describes its purpose, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the test code.

In summary, `tests/test_models.py` serves as a crucial component in ensuring the reliability of the `extract_model_names` function, validating its behavior across various input scenarios, and contributing to the overall robustness of the application.

The `tests/test_rag.py` file is a unit test suite designed to validate the functionality of the `RAGPipeline` class from the `src.core.rag` module. This test suite uses the `unittest` framework, which is a standard testing framework in Python, to ensure that the various components of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline behave as expected. Below is a detailed analysis of the key aspects of this test file:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The main purpose of the `TestRAGPipeline` class is to verify the correctness and robustness of the `RAGPipeline` implementation. It focuses on testing the pipeline's ability to set up its components (retrievers and chains), handle various types of input questions, and manage errors gracefully. The tests ensure that the pipeline behaves correctly under normal and edge cases.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
- **`setUp(self)`**: This method is called before each test case. It initializes mock objects that simulate the behavior of external dependencies, such as the vector database and the LLM (Language Model) manager. It also patches certain classes and methods to control their behavior during tests.
  
- **`tearDown(self)`**: This method is called after each test case to clean up any patches applied during the tests, ensuring that there are no side effects between tests.

- **`test_setup_retriever(self)`**: Tests the `_setup_retriever` method of the `RAGPipeline` to ensure that it correctly initializes the retriever from the vector database.

- **`test_setup_chain(self)`**: Tests the `_setup_chain` method to verify that it correctly sets up the processing chain using the LLM manager.

- **`test_get_response(self)`**: Validates the `get_response` method of the `RAGPipeline`, ensuring it returns the expected response when a valid question is provided.

- **`test_get_response_empty_question(self)`**: Tests how the pipeline handles an empty question, expecting an empty response.

- **`test_get_response_long_question(self)`**: Checks the pipeline's ability to handle very long questions and return the appropriate response.

- **`test_get_response_special_characters(self)`**: Tests the handling of questions that contain special characters to ensure the pipeline can process them correctly.

- **`test_chain_error_handling(self)`**: Simulates an error in the chain's invocation and verifies that the pipeline raises an exception as expected.

- **`test_retriever_error_handling(self)`**: Tests the error handling when the retriever setup fails, ensuring that the pipeline raises an exception.

- **`test_memory_cleanup(self)`**: Ensures that resources are properly managed and cleaned up after operations, verifying that the pipeline behaves correctly under resource constraints.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The `TestRAGPipeline` interacts primarily with:
- **`RAGPipeline`**: The main class being tested, which integrates components for retrieval and language model processing.
- **`MultiQueryRetriever`**: A component responsible for retrieving relevant documents based on queries. The tests ensure that it is correctly instantiated and used within the pipeline.
- **`RunnablePassthrough`**: A utility that may be involved in processing the output from the chain. The tests ensure that it is correctly patched and behaves as expected.
- **`MagicMock` and `Mock`**: These are used extensively to simulate the behavior of complex objects without relying on their actual implementations. This allows for isolated testing of the `RAGPipeline`.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Mocking and Patching**: The use of `Mock` and `patch` from `unittest.mock` is a notable pattern in this test suite. It allows the tests to isolate the `RAGPipeline` from its dependencies, ensuring that tests focus solely on the pipeline's logic.

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The test suite covers a range of scenarios, including normal operations, edge cases (like empty and long questions), and error handling. This comprehensive approach helps ensure the robustness of the `RAGPipeline`.

- **Assertions**: The tests use various assertions (`assertIsNotNone`, `assertEqual`, `assertRaises`) to validate expected outcomes, which is a standard practice in unit testing to verify that the code behaves as intended.

In summary, `tests/test_rag.py` serves as a critical component of the testing strategy for the `RAGPipeline`, ensuring that it functions correctly and handles various scenarios gracefully.

### Analysis of `run.py`

#### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of `run.py` is to serve as an entry point for launching a Streamlit application. It is responsible for checking the existence of the main application file (`main.py`) and executing it using the Streamlit command-line interface. This script ensures that the application is run in an organized manner and provides error handling for common issues, such as missing files or execution failures.

#### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes

- **`main()`**
  - **Inputs:** None
  - **Processing:**
    - It defines the path to the main application file located at `src/app/main.py`.
    - It checks if the specified file exists. If not, it prints an error message and exits the program with a non-zero status.
    - If the file exists, it attempts to run the Streamlit application using the `subprocess.run()` method, passing the command to run the Streamlit app.
    - If the Streamlit command fails (e.g., due to an error in the application), it catches the `subprocess.CalledProcessError`, prints an error message, and exits with a non-zero status.
  - **Outputs:** None (the function exits the program with a status code based on success or failure).

#### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **File Interaction:** The script interacts with the file system by checking for the existence of `src/app/main.py`. This is a crucial interaction as it determines whether the application can be launched.
- **Subprocess Interaction:** It uses the `subprocess` module to invoke the Streamlit command, which means it relies on the Streamlit framework being installed and accessible in the environment where this script is executed.
- **Error Handling:** The script is designed to provide feedback to the user regarding potential issues, such as missing files or execution errors, which is important for debugging and user experience.

#### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Path Handling:** The use of `Path` from the `pathlib` module for file path management is a notable feature. It provides a more flexible and readable way to handle file paths compared to traditional string manipulation.
- **Error Handling:** The script includes robust error handling to manage common issues gracefully. This is a good practice in software development, as it helps prevent crashes and provides meaningful feedback to the user.
- **Modular Structure:** The script is structured in a way that separates the main execution logic into a function (`main()`), which is a common pattern in Python scripts. This modular approach enhances readability and maintainability.
- **Entry Point Check:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct ensures that the `main()` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module in another script. This is a standard practice in Python to allow for code reuse.

In summary, `run.py` is a straightforward yet essential script for launching a Streamlit application, with careful consideration for error handling and modular design.

  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)`.
  - **Outputs**: Expects a return value of an empty tuple `()`.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The tests interact directly with the `extract_model_names` function, which is responsible for extracting model names from a provided input structure. The tests use the `unittest.mock` library to create mock objects that simulate the expected input without needing actual model objects. This allows for isolated testing of the function's logic without dependencies on other components of the system.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Use of Mocking**: The tests utilize the `Mock` class from the `unittest.mock` module to create mock objects. This is a common pattern in unit testing that allows for the simulation of complex objects and behaviors without requiring their full implementations.
- **Assertions**: Each test function includes assertions to validate the output of `extract_model_names`, ensuring that it meets the expected results for various scenarios.
- **Robustness Testing**: The tests cover different edge cases, including empty inputs, invalid formats, and exceptions, which is essential for ensuring the robustness of the function.
- **Clear Documentation**: Each test function includes a docstring that clearly states its purpose, which enhances the readability and maintainability of the test code.

In summary, this test file is crucial for validating the functionality of the `extract_model_names` function, ensuring it can handle various input scenarios effectively, and maintaining the overall reliability of the application.

  - **Outputs**: Asserts that an exception is raised.

- **`test_retriever_error_handling(self)`**: 
  - **Inputs**: None.
  - **Processing**: Simulates an error during the retriever setup and tests if the `RAGPipeline` raises an exception.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that an exception is raised.

- **`test_memory_cleanup(self)`**: 
  - **Inputs**: None.
  - **Processing**: Simulates operations on a new `RAGPipeline` instance and checks that resources are properly managed.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the retriever and chain methods were called.

#### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- The tests interact primarily with the `RAGPipeline` class from `src.core.rag`, which is responsible for managing the retrieval and generation processes.
- Mock objects simulate the behavior of external dependencies such as the vector database and LLM manager, allowing for isolated testing of the `RAGPipeline` functionality without relying on actual implementations.
- The tests also utilize components from the `langchain` library, specifically `MultiQueryRetriever` and `RunnablePassthrough`, which

### Analysis of `run.py`

#### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of `run.py` is to serve as an entry point for launching a Streamlit application. It checks for the existence of the main application script (`src/app/main.py`) and executes it using the Streamlit command-line interface. This script ensures that the application can be started easily from the command line, providing a straightforward way for developers and users to run the application without needing to navigate through the file structure manually.

#### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes

- **`main()`**
  - **Inputs**: None (it does not take any parameters).
  - **Processing**:
    - It defines the path to the main application script (`src/app/main.py`).
    - It checks if this file exists. If it does not, it prints an error message and exits the program with a status code of 1.
    - If the file exists, it attempts to run the Streamlit application using the `subprocess.run()` function, which invokes the Streamlit command with the path to the application script.
  - **Outputs**: 
    - If the application script is not found, it outputs an error message to the console and exits.
    - If the application is successfully launched, it does not return any data but starts the Streamlit server, allowing users to interact with the application via a web browser.
  
#### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **Interaction with `src/app/main.py`**: The script directly interacts with the main application file, which is expected to contain the Streamlit application logic. This file is crucial as it defines the user interface and functionality of the Streamlit app.
- **Use of `subprocess`**: The script utilizes the `subprocess` module to run external commands. This is important for executing the Streamlit command in a separate process, allowing the Streamlit server to run independently of the Python script.
- **Error Handling**: The script includes error handling for both the file existence check and the subprocess execution, ensuring that any issues are communicated to the user effectively.

#### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Path Management**: The use of `Path` from the `pathlib` module provides a more robust way to handle file paths compared to string manipulation. This is especially useful for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Error Handling**: The script employs basic error handling to manage potential issues, such as the absence of the main application file or errors during the execution of the Streamlit command. This enhances the user experience by providing clear feedback on what went wrong.
- **Modular Design**: The script is designed to be executed as a standalone program (due to the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct), which is a common pattern in Python scripts. This allows the script to be imported as a module without executing the main application logic unintentionally.

In summary, `run.py` is a simple yet essential script that facilitates the launching of a Streamlit application by checking for the necessary files and executing the application in a user-friendly manner.

The provided code in `tests/test_models.py` is a set of unit tests designed to validate the functionality of the `extract_model_names` function from the `src.app.main` module. Here’s a breakdown of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The main purpose of this test file is to ensure that the `extract_model_names` function behaves correctly under various scenarios. It verifies that the function can handle different types of input, including empty responses, valid model information, invalid formats, and exceptions. This is crucial for maintaining the reliability of the application, especially when dealing with dynamic data sources.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
The tests in this file are structured around the `extract_model_names` function. Here are the key test functions:

- **`test_extract_model_names_empty`**
  - **Inputs:** `models_info` (Mock object with an empty list for `models`).
  - **Processing:** Calls `extract_model_names` with the empty `models_info`.
  - **Output:** Asserts that the result is an empty tuple `()`.
  
- **`test_extract_model_names_success`**
  - **Inputs:** `models_info` (Mock object with a list containing two mock model objects).
  - **Processing:** Calls `extract_model_names` with the populated `models_info`.
  - **Output:** Asserts that the result is a tuple containing the model names: `("model1:latest", "model2:latest")`.

- **`test_extract_model_names_invalid_format`**
  - **Inputs:** `models_info` (a dictionary with an invalid format).
  - **Processing:** Calls `extract_model_names` with the invalid `models_info`.
  - **Output:** Asserts that the result is an empty tuple `()`.

- **`test_extract_model_names_exception`**
  - **Inputs:** `models_info` (Mock object with the `models` attribute deleted).
  - **Processing:** Calls `extract_model_names` which is expected to raise an `AttributeError` when accessing `models`.
  - **Output:** Asserts that the result is an empty tuple `()`.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The tests interact directly with the `extract_model_names` function, which is presumably responsible for extracting model names from a given input structure. The tests utilize Python's `unittest.mock` library to create mock objects that simulate the expected input structure without requiring actual model objects or data. This allows for isolated testing of the function's logic without dependencies on other parts of the system.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Use of Mocking:** The tests extensively use the `Mock` class from the `unittest.mock` module to create mock objects. This is a common pattern in unit testing that allows developers to simulate complex objects and behaviors without needing the full implementation.
- **Robustness Testing:** The tests cover various scenarios, including edge cases like empty inputs and invalid formats, which is essential for ensuring the robustness of the function.
- **Clear Assertions:** Each test clearly asserts the expected outcome, making it easy to understand what each test is verifying. This clarity aids in maintaining the tests and understanding the expected behavior of the `extract_model_names` function.

Overall, this test file plays a critical role in ensuring that the `extract_model_names` function works as intended and can gracefully handle unexpected inputs or situations.

     - **Processing**: Tests that resources are properly managed after operations.
     - **Outputs**: Asserts that the retriever and chain methods were called, indicating proper resource usage.

3. **Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System:**
   - The tests interact with the `RAGPipeline` class, which is responsible for managing the retrieval and generation of responses based on input queries.
   - Mock objects are used extensively to simulate the behavior of external dependencies like the vector database and the language model manager, allowing for isolated testing of the `RAGPipeline` functionality without relying on actual implementations.

4. **Notable Features or Patterns:**
   - **Use of Mocks**: The tests utilize `unittest.mock` to create mock objects for dependencies, allowing for controlled testing scenarios without side effects from real implementations.
   - **Error Handling Tests**: The tests include scenarios for handling errors in both the retriever setup and the response generation, ensuring robustness in the pipeline.

### Analysis of `run.py`

#### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of `run.py` is to serve as an entry point for launching a Streamlit application. It checks for the existence of the main application script (`src/app/main.py`) and executes it using the Streamlit command-line interface. This script ensures that the application can be run easily from the command line, providing a straightforward way for developers and users to start the application.

#### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes

- **Function: `main()`**
  - **Inputs:** None
  - **Processing:**
    - It constructs a `Path` object pointing to `src/app/main.py`.
    - It checks if this path exists. If not, it prints an error message and exits the program with a status code of 1.
    - If the path exists, it attempts to run the Streamlit application using `subprocess.run()`, passing the command `streamlit run` along with the path to the application script.
  - **Outputs:** None directly, but it can print error messages to the console and exits the program with a status code (0 for success, 1 for failure).

#### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- The script interacts directly with the Streamlit framework by invoking it through the command line. 
- It relies on the existence of `src/app/main.py`, which is assumed to contain the main logic for the Streamlit application. If this file is missing, the script will terminate with an error message.
- The use of `subprocess.run()` indicates that the script is designed to run external commands, specifically the Streamlit command, which means it expects that Streamlit is installed in the environment where this script is executed.

#### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Error Handling:** The script includes error handling for both the file existence check and the subprocess execution. This is a good practice as it provides feedback to the user about what went wrong if the application fails to start.
- **Path Management:** The use of `Path` from the `pathlib` module for file path management is a modern and flexible approach, making the code more readable and less error-prone compared to string manipulation for file paths.

----- analyzeCode - analysis -----
The provided code in `tests/test_models.py` is a set of unit tests designed to verify the functionality of the `extract_model_names` function from the `src.app.main` module. Below is a detailed analysis of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The main purpose of this test file is to ensure that the `extract_model_names` function correctly extracts model names from a given input structure. This function is expected to handle various scenarios, including empty responses, successful extractions, invalid formats, and exceptions. The tests help maintain the reliability and correctness of the model extraction functionality as the codebase evolves.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
The test file contains four key test functions, each validating a specific behavior of the `extract_model_names` function:

- **`test_extract_model_names_empty()`**
  - **Inputs**: A mock object `models_info` with an empty list for `models` (datatype: `Mock`).
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)`.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is an empty tuple (`tuple()`).
  
- **`test_extract_model_names_success()`**
  - **Inputs**: A mock object `models_info` containing two mock model objects (`mock_model1` and `mock_model2`) with `model` attributes set to "model1:latest" and "model2:latest" (datatype: `Mock`).
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)`.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is a tuple containing the model names: `("model1:latest", "model2:latest")`.

- **`test_extract_model_names_invalid_format()`**
  - **Inputs**: A dictionary with an invalid structure (`{"invalid": "format"}`) instead of a mock object (datatype: `dict`).
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)`.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is an empty tuple (`tuple()`).

- **`test_extract_model_names_exception()`**
  - **Inputs**: A mock object `models_info` from which the `models` attribute is deleted to simulate an error (datatype: `Mock`).
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)`.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is an empty tuple (`tuple()`), indicating that the function gracefully handles exceptions.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The tests interact directly with the `extract_model_names` function, which is likely responsible for parsing a response object (expected to have a `models` attribute) and extracting model names from it. The tests use Python's `unittest.mock` library to create mock objects that simulate the expected structure of the input data without requiring actual instances of the model objects. This allows for isolated testing of the extraction logic without dependencies on other parts of the system.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Use of Mock Objects**: The tests leverage `unittest.mock.Mock` to create mock objects that mimic the behavior of real model objects. This is a common pattern in unit testing to isolate the functionality being tested.
- **Assertions for Expected Outcomes**: Each test function includes assertions that check the output of `extract_model_names` against expected results. This ensures that the function behaves correctly under different scenarios.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The tests cover various scenarios, including normal operation, edge cases (empty input), invalid formats, and exception handling, which is crucial for robust software development.
- **Descriptive Docstrings**: Each test function has a docstring that describes its purpose, making it easier for developers to understand the intent of the tests at a glance.

Overall, this test file plays a critical role in validating the functionality of the model extraction logic, ensuring that it behaves as expected in a variety of situations.

### Analysis of `run.py`

#### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of `run.py` is to serve as the entry point for launching a Streamlit application. It checks for the existence of the main application script (`src/app/main.py`) and, if found, executes it using the Streamlit framework. This script simplifies the process of starting the application by encapsulating the necessary checks and commands into a single executable file.

#### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes

- **`main()`**
  - **Inputs:** None
  - **Processing:**
    - It defines the path to the Streamlit application script located at `src/app/main.py`.
    - It checks if this path exists. If not, it prints an error message and exits the program with a status code of `1`.
    - If the path exists, it attempts to run the Streamlit application using the `subprocess.run()` method, which executes the command `streamlit run src/app/main.py`.
  - **Outputs:** None directly, but it can produce output in the form of error messages printed to the console. If successful, it launches the Streamlit application in a separate process.

#### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **File System Interaction:** The script interacts with the file system to check for the existence of the application script (`src/app/main.py`). This is crucial to ensure that the application can be launched without errors.
- **Subprocess Interaction:** It uses the `subprocess` module to run the Streamlit command. This allows the script to execute external commands and handle errors that may arise during the execution of the Streamlit application.
- **Streamlit Framework:** The script directly interacts with the Streamlit framework by invoking it to run the application, which is expected to provide a user interface for the functionalities defined in the application code.

#### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Error Handling:** The script includes basic error handling to manage scenarios where the application script is missing or if there is an issue running the Streamlit application. This is done using `try-except` blocks and checking for the existence of the file.
- **Use of `Path` from `pathlib`:** The script utilizes `Path` from the `pathlib` module for file path management, which provides a more intuitive and flexible way to handle file system paths compared to traditional string manipulation.
- **Modular Design:** The `main()` function encapsulates the core functionality, making the script modular and easier to maintain. This design also allows for potential expansion, such as adding more functionality or configurations in the future.

In summary, `run.py` is a straightforward yet essential script that facilitates the launching of a Streamlit application by managing file checks and subprocess execution, ensuring a smooth user experience when starting the application.

The `chat.py` file is a component of a Streamlit application that implements a chat interface. Below is a detailed analysis of its key functionality and role based on the provided code.

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of the `chat.py` file is to manage and display a chat interface within a Streamlit application. It handles the initialization of chat state, rendering of chat messages, and the addition of new messages to the chat history. This component allows users to interact with an assistant (likely an AI model) through a conversational interface.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes

#### a. `init_chat_state()`
- **Purpose**: Initializes the chat state if it does not already exist in the Streamlit session state.
- **Inputs**: None.
- **Processing**: Checks if the key `"messages"` is present in `st.session_state`. If not, it initializes it as an empty list.
- **Outputs**: None (modifies the session state directly).

#### b. `render_chat_interface(messages: List[Dict])`
- **Purpose**: Renders the chat interface with the history of messages.
- **Inputs**: 
  - `messages`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a message with keys `"role"` (indicating the sender, e.g., "assistant" or "user") and `"content"` (the text of the message).
- **Processing**: 
  - Creates a container for the chat interface with a specified height and border.
  - Iterates over the list of messages and displays each message within the container. It uses different avatars based on the role of the message sender.
- **Outputs**: None (displays messages directly in the Streamlit app).

#### c. `add_message(role: str, content: str)`
- **Purpose**: Adds a new message to the chat history.
- **Inputs**: 
  - `role`: A string indicating the role of the message sender (e.g., "assistant" or "user").
  - `content`: A string containing the text of the message.
- **Processing**: Appends a new dictionary containing the `role` and `content` to the `st.session_state.messages` list.
- **Outputs**: None (modifies the session state directly).

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **Session State Management**: The component heavily relies on Streamlit's session state (`st.session_state`) to store and manage the chat messages. This allows the chat history to persist across user interactions within the same session.
- **Streamlit Integration**: The functions utilize Streamlit's API to create a user interface, specifically using `st.container`, `st.chat_message`, and `st.markdown` to render the chat messages and their avatars.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **State Initialization**: The use of a dedicated function (`init_chat_state`) to initialize the chat state is a good practice, ensuring that the chat history is set up correctly before any messages are rendered.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: The `render_chat_interface` function dynamically generates the chat interface based on the current state of messages, allowing for real-time updates as new messages are added.
- **Role-Based Messaging**: The differentiation between user and assistant messages through the use of avatars enhances the user experience by visually distinguishing the sources of messages.
- **Modular Design**: The separation of concerns in the functions (initialization, rendering, and message addition) promotes code readability and maintainability.

In summary, the `chat.py` file is a crucial component of the Streamlit application, providing a user-friendly chat interface that manages message history and facilitates interaction with an AI assistant.

- **`test_extract_model_names_success()`**
  - **Inputs**: 
    - `models_info`: A mock object with an attribute `models` containing two mock model objects (`mock_model1` and `mock_model2`), each having a `model` attribute with string values ("model1:latest" and "model2:latest").
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)` to extract model names from the mock response.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is a tuple containing the model names (`("model1:latest", "model2:latest")`), indicating successful extraction.

- **`test_extract_model_names_invalid_format()`**
  - **Inputs**: 
    - `models_info`: A dictionary with an invalid format (`{"invalid": "format"}`) that does not contain a `models` attribute.
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)` to test how the function handles unexpected input formats.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is an empty tuple (`()`), indicating that the function correctly handled the invalid format.

- **`test_extract_model_names_exception()`**
  - **Inputs**: 
    - `models_info`: A mock object from which the `models` attribute is deleted, simulating an error scenario.
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)` to see how the function reacts to the absence of the `models` attribute.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is an empty tuple (`()`), indicating that the function gracefully handled the exception (in this case, an `AttributeError`).

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The tests interact with the `extract_model_names` function, which is presumably responsible for processing an object that contains model information. The tests validate that this function can handle various input scenarios, including valid, empty, and malformed data. The tests also rely on the `unittest.mock` library to create mock objects that simulate the expected structure of the input data without requiring actual model instances.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Use of Mocks**: The tests utilize the `Mock` class from the `unittest.mock` module to create mock objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. This allows the tests to focus on the functionality of `extract_model_names` without needing to set up complex dependencies.
- **Clear Assertions**: Each test includes clear assertions that specify the expected output, making it easy to understand the intended behavior of the `extract_model_names` function.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The tests cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases (empty input, invalid format) and error handling (attribute access issues), which contributes to robust testing practices.
- **Descriptive Docstrings**: Each test function has a descriptive docstring that explains its purpose, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the test code.

Overall, this test file serves as a critical component in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the `extract_model_names` function within the application.

----- analyzeCode - analysis -----
The `run.py` script serves as the entry point for launching a Streamlit application within the project. Below is a detailed analysis of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of `run.py` is to execute the Streamlit application defined in the `src/app/main.py` file. It checks for the existence of the application file and then uses the subprocess module to run the Streamlit server, allowing users to interact with the application via a web interface.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes

- **`main()`**:
  - **Inputs**: None directly; it operates within the script's context.
  - **Processing**:
    - It defines the path to the Streamlit application (`src/app/main.py`).
    - It checks if this path exists. If not, it prints an error message and exits the program with a status code of 1.
    - If the file exists, it attempts to run the Streamlit application using `subprocess.run()`, which executes the command `streamlit run src/app/main.py`.
  - **Outputs**: 
    - If the application file is not found, it outputs an error message and exits.
    - If the application fails to run, it catches the error and prints an error message before exiting.
  
### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **File Interaction**: The script interacts with the file system to check for the existence of `src/app/main.py`. This is crucial as it ensures that the application can be launched only if the main application file is present.
- **Subprocess Interaction**: The script uses the `subprocess` module to invoke the Streamlit command-line interface, which runs the application. This interaction allows the script to leverage the capabilities of Streamlit to serve the web application.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Error Handling**: The script employs error handling to manage situations where the application file is missing or when the Streamlit application fails to start. This is done using `try-except` blocks, which is a common pattern in Python for managing exceptions gracefully.
- **Path Management**: The use of `Path` from the `pathlib` module provides a more flexible and readable way to handle file paths compared to traditional string manipulation. This enhances the script's portability and readability.
- **Entry Point Check**: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct ensures that the `main()` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module in another script. This is a standard practice in Python to allow for modular code.

In summary, `run.py` is a straightforward yet essential script that facilitates the execution of the Streamlit application by ensuring the necessary files are in place and handling any errors that may arise during the launch process.

The `src/core/llm.py` file is responsible for managing the configuration and setup of a Language Model (LLM) within the application. It utilizes the `langchain_ollama` library to interact with a specific LLM model, in this case, "llama2". Below is a detailed analysis of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of the `LLMManager` class in this file is to encapsulate the setup and management of an LLM, specifically focusing on generating prompts for querying and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It abstracts the complexity of interacting with the LLM and provides methods to create templates for user queries and responses based on context.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes

- **`__init__(self, model_name: str = "llama2")`**
  - **Inputs**: 
    - `model_name`: A string representing the name of the LLM model to be used (default is "llama2").
  - **Processing**: Initializes the `LLMManager` instance and creates an instance of `ChatOllama` with the specified model name.
  - **Outputs**: No return value; it sets up the instance variable `self.llm` for further use.

- **`get_query_prompt(self) -> PromptTemplate`**
  - **Inputs**: None.
  - **Processing**: Constructs a `PromptTemplate` that generates two different versions of a user question. This is aimed at enhancing the retrieval of relevant documents from a vector database by providing alternative phrasings of the original question.

- **`get_rag_prompt(self) -> ChatPromptTemplate`**
  - **Inputs**: None.
  - **Processing**: Creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` that is designed to answer a question based solely on provided context. This is particularly useful for RAG scenarios where the model needs to reference specific information.
  - **Outputs**: Returns a `ChatPromptTemplate` object that contains the template for answering questions based on context.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- The `LLMManager` class interacts with the `ChatOllama` class from the `langchain_ollama` library, which is responsible for the actual language model operations. By instantiating `ChatOllama`, the `LLMManager` can leverage the capabilities of the LLM for generating responses based on the prompts it creates.
- The prompts generated by `get_query_prompt` and `get_rag_prompt` are likely used in other parts of the application where user queries and context-based answers are processed, possibly in a chat interface or a document retrieval system.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Encapsulation**: The `LLMManager` class encapsulates the logic for managing the LLM and its prompts, promoting separation of concerns. This makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
- **Prompt Templates**: The use of `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate` indicates a structured approach to prompt design, which is crucial for ensuring that the LLM generates relevant and coherent outputs.
- **Default Parameters**: The constructor uses a default parameter for the model name, allowing flexibility in choosing different models without requiring changes to the instantiation code.
- **Logging**: The inclusion of a logger (though not actively used in the provided code) suggests that there may be plans for logging important events or errors, which is a good practice for debugging and monitoring.

Overall, the `src/core/llm.py` file plays a critical role in managing the interaction with the LLM, providing a clean interface for generating prompts that enhance the user experience in querying and retrieving information.

  - **Processing**: Sets up a processing chain that combines the retriever, the prompt for the RAG process, and the LLM, culminating in an output parser.
  - **Outputs**: Returns the configured processing chain (type: Any).

- **`get_response(self, question: str) -> str`**
  - **Inputs**: 
    - `question`: A string representing the user's question (type: str).
  - **Processing**: Logs the question and invokes the processing chain to generate a response based on the provided question.
  - **Outputs**: Returns the generated response as a string (type: str).

#### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- **Interaction with `LLMManager`**: The `RAGPipeline` relies on the `LLMManager` to obtain the language model and the prompts necessary for querying and processing. This indicates a modular design where the LLM management is abstracted away from the RAG pipeline.
  
- **Interaction with `MultiQueryRetriever`**: The retriever is set up to fetch relevant documents or information from the vector database, which is crucial for the RAG process. The retriever's output is used as context for the LLM to generate a more informed response.

- **Logging**: The use of the `logging` module allows the class to log important events and errors, which is essential for debugging and monitoring the pipeline's performance.

#### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Error Handling**: The class includes try-except blocks around critical setup functions and the response generation method. This ensures that any issues during initialization or processing are logged and raised, preventing silent failures and aiding in troubleshooting.

- **Modular Design**: The separation of concerns is evident in the way the retriever and processing chain are set up in dedicated methods. This makes the code easier to maintain and extend, as changes to the retrieval or processing logic can be made independently.

- **Use of Type Hints**: The code employs type hints (e.g., `Any`, `MultiQueryRetriever`, `str`) to clarify expected input and output types, enhancing readability and aiding static analysis tools.

Overall, the `rag.py` file encapsulates the logic for a RAG pipeline, effectively combining retrieval and generation capabilities to respond to user queries with contextually relevant information.

The provided code in `tests/test_models.py` is a set of unit tests designed to validate the functionality of the `extract_model_names` function from the `src.app.main` module. Here's a detailed analysis of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The main purpose of this test file is to ensure that the `extract_model_names` function behaves correctly under various conditions. It verifies that the function can handle different types of input, including empty responses, successful data extraction, invalid formats, and exceptions. By doing so, it helps maintain the reliability and robustness of the application.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes

- **`test_extract_model_names_empty`**:
  - **Inputs**: A mock object `models_info` with an empty list for the `models` attribute.
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names` with the empty `models_info`.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is an empty tuple `()`.
  
- **`test_extract_model_names_success`**:
  - **Inputs**: A mock object `models_info` containing two mock model objects, each with a `model` attribute set to "model1:latest" and "model2:latest".
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names` with the populated `models_info`.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is a tuple containing the model names: `("model1:latest", "model2:latest")`.

- **`test_extract_model_names_invalid_format`**:
  - **Inputs**: A dictionary `models_info` with an invalid structure (missing the `models` attribute).
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names` with this invalid input.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is an empty tuple `()`.

- **`test_extract_model_names_exception`**:
  - **Inputs**: A mock object `models_info` from which the `models` attribute is deleted to simulate an error condition.
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names` with the modified `models_info`.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the result is an empty tuple `()`.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The tests interact directly with the `extract_model_names` function, which is presumably responsible for extracting model names from a given input structure. The tests use the `unittest.mock` library to create mock objects that simulate the expected input format for the function. This allows for controlled testing of the function's behavior without needing to rely on actual model data.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Use of Mocks**: The tests utilize the `Mock` class from the `unittest.mock` module to create mock objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. This is particularly useful for isolating the function being tested and avoiding dependencies on other parts of the system.
- **Assertions**: Each test includes assertions to verify that the output of `extract_model_names` matches the expected results. This is a standard practice in unit testing to ensure correctness.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The tests cover various scenarios, including empty inputs, successful extractions, invalid formats, and exception handling. This comprehensive approach helps ensure that the function is robust and can handle unexpected situations gracefully.

Overall, this test suite plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality of the codebase by ensuring that the `extract_model_names` function behaves as expected across a range of scenarios.

### Analysis of `run.py`

#### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The primary purpose of the `run.py` script is to serve as an entry point for launching a Streamlit application. It checks for the existence of the main application file (`src/app/main.py`) and, if found, executes it using the Streamlit command-line interface. This script ensures that the application can be easily started from the command line, providing a straightforward way for developers and users to run the application without needing to navigate to the specific directory or manually invoke Streamlit.

#### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
- **`main()`**
  - **Inputs**: None
  - **Processing**:
    - It defines the path to the main application file as `src/app/main.py`.
    - It checks if this file exists. If not, it prints an error message and exits the program with a status code of `1` (indicating an error).
    - If the file exists, it attempts to run the Streamlit application using `subprocess.run()`, passing the command `["streamlit", "run", str(app_path)]`.
    - If the Streamlit command fails (raises a `CalledProcessError`), it catches the exception, prints an error message, and exits with status code `1`.
  - **Outputs**: None (but may print error messages to the console).

#### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- The script interacts primarily with the Streamlit framework by invoking it through the command line. It relies on the existence of the main application file (`src/app/main.py`), which is expected to contain the Streamlit application code.
- The script uses the `subprocess` module to run external commands, specifically to execute the Streamlit app. This means that it indirectly interacts with the Streamlit library and any dependencies defined in the project (e.g., in `requirements.txt`).

#### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling to manage situations where the main application file is missing or if the Streamlit application fails to start. This is a good practice for improving the robustness of the script.
- **Path Management**: It uses the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module for file path management, which is a modern and flexible way to handle file paths in Python.
- **Modular Design**: The `main()` function encapsulates the script's logic, making it easy to read and maintain. The use of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct allows the script to be imported without executing the main function, which is a common Python pattern for script files.

Overall, `run.py` is a simple yet effective script that serves as a launcher for the Streamlit application, ensuring that users can start the app easily while providing basic error handling to enhance user experience.

#### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The `embeddings.py` file is primarily responsible for managing vector embeddings and database operations related to those embeddings. It utilizes the `OllamaEmbeddings` model to convert documents into vector representations and stores these vectors in a database using the `Chroma` vector store. This functionality is crucial for applications that require semantic search, document retrieval, or any task that benefits from understanding the context of text data.

#### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes

- **`__init__(self, embedding_model: str = "nomic-embed-text")`**
  - **Inputs:** 
    - `embedding_model`: a string representing the name of the embedding model to use (default is `"nomic-embed-text"`).
  - **Processing:** Initializes an instance of the `VectorStore` class. It creates an `OllamaEmbeddings` object using the specified model and initializes `vector_db` to `None`.
  - **Outputs:** No return value; it sets up the instance for further operations.

- **`create_vector_db(self, documents: List, collection_name: str = "local-rag") -> Chroma`**
  - **Inputs:** 
    - `documents`: a list of documents (of unspecified type) that will be converted into vector embeddings.
    - `collection_name`: a string representing the name of the collection in the vector database (default is `"local-rag"`).
  - **Processing:** 
    - Logs the creation of the vector database.
    - Uses the `Chroma.from_documents` method to create a vector database from the provided documents and the initialized embeddings.
    - Assigns the created vector database to `self.vector_db`.
  - **Outputs:** Returns the created `Chroma` vector database instance.

- **`delete_collection(self) -> None`**
  - **Inputs:** None.
  - **Processing:** 
    - Checks if `self.vector_db` is not `None`.
    - Logs the deletion of the vector database collection.
    - Calls the `delete_collection` method on the `vector_db` to remove the collection and sets `self.vector_db` to `None`.
  - **Outputs:** No return value; it performs a side effect of deleting the collection.

#### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
- The `VectorStore` class interacts with:
  - **`OllamaEmbeddings`:** This class is responsible for generating vector embeddings from text documents. It is instantiated in the `__init__` method and used in the `create_vector_db` method.
  - **`Chroma`:** This is the vector store that manages the storage and retrieval of vector embeddings. The `create_vector_db` method uses `Chroma.from_documents` to create a new vector database and `delete_collection` to remove it when needed.
  
This class serves as a bridge between the document processing (through embeddings) and the storage/retrieval mechanisms (via the vector database).

#### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Logging:** The use of the `logging` module allows for monitoring the operations within the class, which is essential for debugging and understanding the flow of operations.
- **Error Handling:** The `try-except` blocks in both `create_vector_db` and `delete_collection` methods handle exceptions gracefully, logging errors and re-raising them. This ensures that the application can respond to issues without crashing unexpectedly.
- **Type Annotations:** The use of type hints (e.g., `List` for documents and `Chroma` for return types) improves code readability and helps with static type checking, making the codebase more maintainable.

Overall, the `embeddings.py` file encapsulates the logic for managing vector embeddings and their storage, which is a critical component for applications that rely on semantic understanding of text data.

It is responsible for verifying the correctness of model name extraction from a given input structure, which is expected to contain model information. The tests cover different cases, including empty responses, successful extractions, invalid formats, and exception handling.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes
The test suite contains four key test functions, each designed to validate a specific aspect of the `extract_model_names` function:

- **`test_extract_model_names_empty()`**
  - **Inputs**: A mock object `models_info` with an empty list for `models`.
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)`.
  - **Outputs**: Expects a tuple `()` (empty tuple).
  
- **`test_extract_model_names_success()`**
  - **Inputs**: A mock object `models_info` containing two mock model objects, each with a `model` attribute set to "model1:latest" and "model2:latest".
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)`.
  - **Outputs**: Expects a tuple `("model1:latest", "model2:latest")`.

- **`test_extract_model_names_invalid_format()`**
  - **Inputs**: A dictionary `models_info` with an invalid format (missing the expected structure).
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)`.
  - **Outputs**: Expects a tuple `()` (empty tuple).

- **`test_extract_model_names_exception()`**
  - **Inputs**: A mock object `models_info` from which the `models` attribute is deleted to simulate an error condition.
  - **Processing**: Calls `extract_model_names(models_info)`.
  - **Outputs**: Expects a tuple `()` (empty tuple).

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The test suite interacts directly with the `extract_model_names` function from the `src.app.main` module. It uses the `unittest.mock` library to create mock objects that simulate the expected input structure for the function. This allows the tests to focus on the behavior of `extract_model_names` without needing a real implementation of the model objects.

### 4. Notable Features or Patterns
- **Use of Mocks**: The tests extensively use the `Mock` class from the `unittest.mock` module to create mock objects, which helps isolate the function being tested and control the input it receives.
- **Testing Edge Cases**: The suite includes tests for edge cases, such as empty inputs and invalid formats, which is a good practice in unit testing to ensure robustness.
- **Assertions**: Each test uses assertions to verify that the output of `extract_model_names` matches the expected result, ensuring that any changes to the function's implementation can be validated against these expectations.

Overall, this test file serves as a crucial component in maintaining the reliability of the `extract_model_names` function by ensuring it handles various scenarios correctly.

The `tests/test_rag.py` file is a unit test suite designed to validate the functionality of the `RAGPipeline` class, which is part of a system that likely implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for processing documents and generating responses based on user queries. Below is a detailed analysis of its key functionality and role:

### 1. Main Purpose and Responsibilities
The main purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `RAGPipeline` class behaves as expected under various scenarios. It verifies that the methods within the class correctly set up the retriever and chain components, handle user queries, and manage errors appropriately. The tests also check that resources are properly cleaned up after use.

### 2. Key Functions and Their Purposes

- **`setUp(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: None
  - **Processing**: Initializes mock objects for the vector database and language model manager. It patches the `MultiQueryRetriever` and `RunnablePassthrough` classes to avoid using real implementations during testing. It also sets up a mock chain that simulates the behavior of the actual chain used in the RAG pipeline.
  - **Outputs**: Initializes the `rag` instance of `RAGPipeline` using the mocked components.

- **`tearDown(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: None
  - **Processing**: Stops the patches created in `setUp` to clean up the testing environment.
  - **Outputs**: None (cleanup operation).

- **`test_setup_retriever(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: None
  - **Processing**: Calls the `_setup_retriever` method of the `rag` instance and checks if the retriever is created successfully.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the retriever is not `None` and that the `as_retriever` method of the mock vector database was called once.

- **`test_setup_chain(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: None
  - **Processing**: Calls the `_setup_chain` method of the `rag` instance and verifies that the chain is set up correctly.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the chain is not `None` and matches the expected mock chain.

- **`test_get_response(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: A string `question` (e.g., "What is this document about?")
  - **Processing**: Calls the `get_response` method with the question and checks if the response matches the expected output.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the response is correct and that the chain's `invoke` method was called with the question.

- **`test_get_response_empty_question(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: An empty string as the question.
  - **Processing**: Tests the `get_response` method with an empty question.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the response is also an empty string.

- **`test_get_response_long_question(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: A long string as the question.
  - **Processing**: Tests the `get_response` method with a long question.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the response matches the expected output for long questions.

- **`test_get_response_special_characters(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: A string with special characters in the question.
  - **Processing**: Tests how the `get_response` method handles questions with special characters.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the response is correct.

- **`test_chain_error_handling(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: A string as the question.
  - **Processing**: Simulates an error in the chain's `invoke` method and tests the error handling in `get_response`.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that an exception is raised.

- **`test_retriever_error_handling(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: None
  - **Processing**: Simulates an error when setting up the retriever and tests the error handling in the `RAGPipeline` constructor.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that an exception is raised.

- **`test_memory_cleanup(self)`**:
  - **Inputs**: None
  - **Processing**: Tests that resources are properly managed after operations are performed.
  - **Outputs**: Asserts that the retriever and chain methods are called, indicating that resources were used correctly.

### 3. Important Interactions with Other Parts of the System
The `TestRAGPipeline` class interacts with:
- **`RAGPipeline`**: The primary class being tested, which integrates components for document retrieval and response generation.
- **`MultiQueryRetriever`**: A class from the `langchain` library that retrieves documents
