  "callHierarchy": "Given the provided information about the project, it is clear that there are no code files or directories available for analysis. The repository consists solely of a `README.md` file, which serves as documentation. As such, there is no executable code, function definitions, or call hierarchy to analyze.\n\n### Summary of Findings\n- **Entry Point**: There is no entry point since there are no code files.\n- **Main Execution Flow**: There is no execution flow to describe as there are no functions or modules.\n- **Important Function Calls**: There are no functions or calls to highlight.\n- **Dependencies Between Modules**: There are no modules or dependencies present.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe repository is essentially a documentation placeholder without any code. To create a call hierarchy or analyze the execution flow, the repository would need to contain at least one source code file with defined functions and a structure that allows for execution.\n\nIf you are looking to develop this project further, consider adding source code files that define the application's functionality, which would then allow for a meaningful analysis of the call hierarchy and execution flow."
