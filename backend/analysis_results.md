### Explanation of the Call Hierarchy

1. **Entry Point**:
   - The entry point for the backend is `backend/index.js`, which sets up the Express server and handles API requests. The main function here is `sendUpdate(message: string)` which sends updates to the client during the analysis process.

2. **Main Execution Flow**:
   - The main execution flow starts with the `analyzeRepository(repoUrl: string)` function in `backend/src/analyzer.js`. This function orchestrates the analysis of a GitHub repository by calling various helper functions to parse the URL, build the file tree, analyze the project structure, and generate summaries.

3. **Important Function Calls**:
   - The `analyzeRepository` function calls several other functions:
     - `parseGitHubUrl` to extract the owner and repository name from the provided URL.
     - `buildFileTree` to create a hierarchical representation of the files in the repository.
     - `analyzeProjectStructure`, `summarizeContent`, and `analyzeCode` to perform deeper analysis on the repository's content.
     - `analyzeCallHierarchy` to analyze the call hierarchy based on the project understanding and file metadata.

4. **Dependencies Between Modules**:
   - The `analyzeRepository` function relies on utility functions from `github.js`, `fileTree.js`, and `file.js` for parsing, building structures, and formatting.
   - The `displayResults` function in `display.js` is used to output the analysis results to the console.
   - The frontend component `App` handles user interactions and calls the backend API to fetch analysis results.

This structured call hierarchy provides a clear view of how the application flows from the entry point through various files and functions, highlighting the important function calls and dependencies between modules.
